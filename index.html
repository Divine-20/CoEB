            CoEB engages in educational and awareness-raising initiatives through
            community outreach programs, aiming to educate the forthcoming
            generation, encompassing both young individuals and local communities,
            about the significance of biodiversity and natural resources management.
            The intention is to underline the critical role environmental protection
            plays in sustainable development and the enduring conservation of
            biodiversity, which in turn contributes to global well-being via the
            Communication and Outreach department of CoEB.
